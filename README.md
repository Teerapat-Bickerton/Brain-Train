# Features

## Landing Page

* When the user arrives at the page, I wanted it to be a simple and straight forward layout where it is easy to tell what they need to do.
* On arrival on the page the user is greeted with the name of the quiz, and it tells the user it's a general knowledge quiz and also a start button to begin the quiz.
